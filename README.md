# IPTC Metadata Extractor

This project aims to extract IPTC metadata from images. IPTC metadata includes important details like location, caption, and photographer. It's written in Dart and is intended to be used in Flutter mobile applications.

## Contributions Welcome!

I'm still working on improving this project and would really appreciate any help. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to discuss enhancements.

Thanks xoxo
